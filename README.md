## Demo files for 'Unravelling Threads In Node.js' presentation at NYC Node.js

1. `server.js` is a demo of how cpu-intensive tasks can block the main thread
2. `workerThreads.js` is a demo of the new worker_threads module in Node.js (make sure you have a recent version of Node.js)
3. `blockingDemo.js` and `blockingDemoWithCluster.js` are demonstrations of child processes, with `fibInRange.js` serving as a sample CPU-intensive operation
